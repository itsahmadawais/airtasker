# AirTasker

**AirTasker** is not just a Todo App—it's your complete daily planner that helps you organize and manage your tasks efficiently.

## About AirTasker

AirTasker is a comprehensive task planning application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Unlike simple todo applications, AirTasker serves as your entire planning system, designed to help you structure and manage your daily tasks effectively.

## Features

- **Complete Daily Planner**: More than just a todo list—a full-featured planning system
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses Web APIs `localStorage` to ensure your tasks are saved and persist across browser sessions
- **Task Management**: Create, update, and organize your daily tasks with ease
- **Modern UI**: Built with React and TypeScript for a smooth, responsive user experience

## Technology Stack

- **React** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Web APIs** - `localStorage` for persistent data storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the local development URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

## How It Works

AirTasker leverages the browser's `localStorage` Web API to automatically save your tasks. This means:
- Your tasks persist even after closing the browser
- No backend server required—everything runs in your browser
- Fast and reliable data storage

This project uses:
- React with TypeScript for type safety
